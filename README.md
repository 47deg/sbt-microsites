# sbt-microsites

**sbt-microsites** is a SBT plugin that facilitates the creation of fancy microsites for your projects, with minimal tweaks.

## What is a microsite?

A microsite is an instance of Jekyll, ready to publish a static web page for your new library. Some of the benefits of having these auto-generated web pages are:

- You can write documentation easily in markdown format.
- Templates, layouts, styles and other resources will be able through the plugin at compile time
- You don't have to deal with the styling.

Please, see the [documentation](https://47deg.github.io/sbt-microsites/docs.html) for more information on setup, installation, etc.
