# Publish with Travis

In this section, weâ€™re going to learn how to configure Travis so you can publish your microsite when you merge in master. You can follow these steps:

**1- Generate an SSH key pair**

Run this command in your console

```
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "Travis Deploy Key" -f travis-deploy-key
```

After that, you'll see two new files in your folder: `travis-deploy-key` and `travis-deploy-key.pub`

_**Note:** If you are creating the keys in your project maybe you should add these files to your .gitignore file_.

**2- Add key to GitHub Project**

Add the content of `travis-deploy-key.pub` in the `Deploy Key` section of the GitHub project's setting page.

Navigate to `Setting` > `Deploy Keys`. Make sure you allow write access in order to push in this repository.

**3- Encrypt your keys**

Travis needs the keys for publishing the microsite in `gh-pages` branch. It's very important that you encrypt your keys using the `travis` command line. You have to install travis:

```
$ gem install travis
```

_**Note:** An important thing to remember is that you can only have one file encrypted in Travis. If you need more keys you should use `tar` for joining your different keys. In our example, we only are going to use the key_

We have to encrypt the `travis-deploy-key` file and we have to add the encrypted file to GitHub.

First, we must be logged into travis:

```
$ travis login
```

Secondly, encrypt the file:

```
$ travis encrypt-file travis-deploy-key travis-deploy-key.enc
```

You are going to see the following response:

```
encrypting travis-deploy-key for [org]/[project]
storing result as travis-deploy-key.enc

Please add the following to your build script (before_install stage in your .travis.yml, for instance):

    openssl aes-256-cbc -K $encrypted_[your_number]_key -iv $encrypted_[your_number]_iv -in travis-deploy-key.enc -out travis-deploy-key -d

Pro Tip: You can add it automatically by running with --add.

Make sure to add keys.tar.enc to the git repository.
Make sure not to add keys.tar to the git repository.
Commit all changes to your .travis.yml.

```

Finally, add the encrypted file to your git:

```
$ git add travis-deploy-key.enc
```

**4- Configure your .travis.yml**

Our recommendation is that you should use `Bash Scripts` and run the script when you merge the changes in master.

This is the `.travis.yml` in `sbt-microsite` project:

```
language: scala
scala:
- 2.10.6
jdk:
- oraclejdk8
before_install:
- if [ "$TRAVIS_BRANCH" = "master" -a "$TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST" = "false" ]; then bash
  scripts/decrypt-keys.sh; fi
- export PATH=${PATH}:./vendor/bundle
install:
- rvm use 2.2.3 --install --fuzzy
- gem update --system
- gem install sass
- gem install jekyll -v 3.2.1
script:
- sbt ++$TRAVIS_SCALA_VERSION test scripted
after_success:
- if [ "$TRAVIS_BRANCH" = "master" -a "$TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST" = "false" ]; then bash
  scripts/publishMicrosite.sh; fi
- if [ "$TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST" = "true" ]; then echo "Not in master branch, skipping
  deploy and release"; fi
```

You can see that before we install, we run `decrypt-keys.sh`, then we install `jekyll` and finally, we are running `publishMicrosite.sh`.

Next, you can see the `decrypt-keys.sh` script:

```
#!/bin/sh

openssl aes-256-cbc -K $encrypted_[your_number]_key -iv $encrypted_[your_number]_iv -in travis-deploy-key.enc -out travis-deploy-key -d;
chmod 600 travis-deploy-key;
cp travis-deploy-key ~/.ssh/id_rsa;
```

The most important thing here is the `openssl` command. You should use the command that you receive as a response when you encrypt the file using the `travis` command above.

In this script, we decrypt the keys and copy `.ssh` to the folder in order to publish it in GitHub later.

Next, you can see the `publishMicrosite.sh` script:

```
#!/bin/bash
set -e

git config --global user.email "your_user_email"
git config --global user.name "your_user_name"
git config --global push.default simple

sbt docs/publishMicrosite
```

In this script, we are publishing the microsite in GitHub Pages. To do this, we should add the user information for git.
